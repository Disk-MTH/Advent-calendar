commit n°6:

1) Complete overhaul of the configuration system:

    Before the configuration was in the resource files so that when the project was compiled the configuration was in the executable's temporary working folder. 
    This had 2 consequences:
       - First, when the project was compiled, the configuration was not saved because it was not put back into the executable (which is normal)
       - Second thing, the configuartion was synchronized at the outset which caused bugs in some cases
 
    Now the configuration is only synchronized when starting and stopping the program and it is saved in the
    following path: "% USERPROFILE% / AppData / Roaming / Advent-calendar / settings.txt". So now if you change the configuration, close 
    the program and then reopen it, you will still have your settings saved.
 

 2) Major rewrite of the code and application of the PEP8 conventions:

    The code is much lighter than before and in addition to redoing the configuration system, I have also greatly improved the functions relating to the configuration verification


 3) Partial addition of the GUI relating to the day buttons:
    
    The buttons are functional and open a GUi but which is absolutely not finished. For the moment the only way to quit this GUI and crash the program
